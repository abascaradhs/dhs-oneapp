**USDS Note:** *This was our original thinking about goals for the project. Some of these may be outdated.*

### Design Principles
   * Easy to understand - applicant can easily make it through the process
   * Simple as possible - applicant can complete the process in a minimal amount of steps
   * Enables informed decisions - applicant understands implications of their actions in the process
   * Accessible - responsive, mobile friendly, and ADA compliant

### Vision
*Deliver a re-engineered and refashioned OneApp that prioritizes the user's needs, can be easily maintained/evolved by NJ DHS and that serves as a USDS national model for a modern safety net benefit application.* 

### Objectives:
- Build cross-browser- & mobile-friendly app
- Build in collaboration with users 
- *Build in collaboration with NJ DHS stakeholders to ensure the new OneApp is easily maintained/sustained*

### MVP prioritization criteria
- 1:
  - User can complete an application end-to-end *(and worker can complete eligibility process)*
  - Application is compliant with laws and regs
  - Mobile & cross-browser friendly
- 2:
  - Increase enrollment
  - Decrease time to benefits
- 3:
  - *Easy to self- maintain/sustain by NJ-DHS*

### Success metrics
- Reduce abandonment rate
- *Speed app time to load/render (more peformant)*
- Increase user rating
- Reduce average time to complete
- Maintain or decrease average time to benefit receipt *Q: How will app do this given the human intervention required*


### Delivery Goal
- *Deliver and Deploy new OneApp by October*

### Immediate goals
- Dev Environment  Set-Up
- Database access or copy (done!)
- Meeting re: NJ-DHS UAT/Q-A and Sign-off Process

### Next goals
- Finalize UX Approach
- Complete Dev Set-up w/DB
- Map UAT/Q-A and Sign-Off process

- Application Starts/Unfinshed Rate (User starts application and enters more than one page of data)
  - <Awaiting>
  
- Average time to complete application
  - Currently 20-45 minutes, depending on the services the user selects and the number of individuals in the household.
  - Goal: 10-30 minutes?



## Option 1: Re-Skin
* Goal: Make OneApp *Better* as quickly as possible
* Design / Usability
   * UI design and plain language updates
   * Support mobile and cross-browser
   * ~50 pages to re-skin
   * Application flow would remain the same, and still be cumbersome to navigate
   * *Question for Jenn: Will we address any accessibility issues?*
* Tech
  * Preserve existing ASP.net code/framework, with minor changes 
  * Presentation remains intertwined with application logic
* Training
   * Least amount of training required (on-boarding with Github and knowledge transfer)
   * Any new frameworks we put in place
* Risks
  * Low
    * We keep the tech the same, but we also don't get a ton of benefit
* Time-frame (est.)
   * 4-6 weeks
* Pros
  * Can take an iterative approach, making small changes and releases to the application as we go
* Cons
  * A pure re-skin option will not allow us to easily remove popups
    * To remove popups we'd need to modify the flow and create new pages, putting us into re-skin and re-order territory
    * We *might* be able to re-style popups to be more mobile friendly (i.e. take over the whole screen and fit on the screen)
  * Much of the UI is generated by the AJAX Toolkit, so we may be limited on how mobile-friendly or cross-browser compatible we can get without ripping out the plugin and going with something else, which pushes us toward making server changes

## Option 2: Re-skin & Re-Order
* Goal: Make OneApp experience *Good* in a reasonable time-frame.
* Design / Usability
   * Drastic UX improvements, with changes to the application flow overall
   * Fields that are not captured in the UI may be "deprecated" in FAMIS (blank / empty going forward)
   * *Question for Jenn: Will we address any accessibility issues?*
* Tech
   * Modify/re-factor the existing ASP.net code to support moderate changes to the app user flow
   * Still use ASP.net for the back-end, but change the front-end as needed
     * We might put some new front-end frameworks in place, but we wouldn't go so far as to introduce tools like React
   * Back-end would still require changes to support new flow, removed fields, new pages (i.e. removing popups)
   * Database schema changes may be required for some flow changes
* Training
   * Some amount of training required to familiarize the NJ-DHS team with changes to the ASP.net code and front-end. Tools would largely remain the same.
* Risks
   * Moderate
     * Could be more complicated than anticipated, stretching commitment timeline (USDS version of a mini-quagmire)
     * Will require more testing to ensure no impact to existing data model (downstream applications consuming data model)
* Timeframe (est.)
   * 6-12+ weeks (depending on scope)
* Pros
  * More flexibility on what we can do
  * Overall tools that the NJ team needs training on remains similar to what they've used
* Cons
  * Might take as much time as a fresh rebuild
  * Leaves New Jersey with a nicer looking application, but the underlying core of the application would remain dated, and would still need to be overhauled at some point in the future

## Option 3: Redesign & Rebuild
* Goal: Rethink the OneApp application and leave NJ with a solid foundation for the future
* Design / Usability
   * Brand new UI, allowing for full rethinking of the application flow
   * Fully mobile-friendly
   * Fully cross-browser friendly
* Tech
   * Rebuild fresh
   * Database would remain the same
     * This is possible because the bulk of the application logic is in database procedures
     * Database schema changes may be required for some flow changes
   * New API-based back-end
   * New front-end build off US Web Design system or equivalent
* Training
   * Would need to fully train the NJ team on all the changes we make
     * This would involve technologies they probably have not worked with before
     * We'd need to support the application for a while after launch to ensure the NJ team is able to manage the application themselves
* Risks
   * Moderate to High
     * More effort on training and support
     * Getting buy-in on a brand new application may be difficult (ex. different server requirements for hosting, security analysis, additional testing, etc)
* Timeframe (est.)
   * 12+ weeks
* Pros
  * Fully flexibility on what we do
  * Compatible with a larger effort to build a "one-system meets all states needs" approach
  * If we devote the proper time, leaves NJ with a great system for the future
* Cons
  * Need to fully analyze each flow and understand all of the business rules, as we'll be rebuilding those rules
  * Resourcing and buy-in. We won't be able to build this in 12 weeks with just part-time development support
  * Building a fresh system will open the door to scope creep that may go beyond our initial goals. When we're not constrained with existing technology, it's easier to say yes to requests

# Project History
With the nation's government services sector facing unprecedented challenges in the face of the Coronavirus pandemic, USDS has the opportunity to provide emergency assistance to hard-pressed state governments as they meet new demands for vital online services.

In the April, the state of New Jersey Office of Innovation -- created by Governor Phil Murphy in August, 2018 with the mandate to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by designing and deploying more effective and efficient government services--asked USDS to deploy a team to address design and functional issues impacting the performance of the state's unemployment benefits weekly certification online application.

In June, officials with the New Jersey Department of Human Services asked for USDS expertise and help as well.  The goal: to improve the usability of the state's nearly 15 year-old online safety net online application, OneApp which enables hard-pressed residents and families to apply for food and economic assistance via three programsL: SNAP, TANF and General Assistance.  As of May 2020, the NJ SNAP program alone served about 700,000 New Jerseyans in 356,000 households. [More details about NJ Snap here.](https://github.com/usds/covid-19/blob/master/new-jersey/safety-net-benefits/background-info/NJ_SNAP_Facts.md)

For USDS, the New Jersey projects represent a new opportunity to help modernize and improve government services.
