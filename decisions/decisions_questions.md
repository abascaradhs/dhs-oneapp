## Questions 

### For NJ DHS

- **Success Metrics**
  - Need Juan to confirm baseline for abadonment rate -- based on data provided so far, current abadon rate could be anywhere from 43-55%
  - Need Juan to help translate data provided by Carmen into a "percent complete" baseline (e.g. on average, only <>% of the application is completed when submitted.

- **Department of Corrections new policy questions**
  - Need Alecia/Juan to finalize if new questions for prisoners need to be added to the application
  
- **NJ DHS Change Requests**
  - Need to determine if all requested changes are (a) well defined/understood and (b) required (or can be de-scoped) for MVP launch.
